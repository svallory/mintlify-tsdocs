## The Easiest Way to Document Your Code

Just run the command below in your Typescript library and answer a few questions.

```bash
npx mint-tsdocs
```

`mint-tsdocs` will automatically detect your TypeScript project, ask a few configuration questions,
and set everything up.

If you haven't configured your Mintlify docs yet, we'll do that for you too!

## Built on Solid Foundations

mint-tsdocs is powered by Microsoft's excellent [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) and [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) projects, which handle the complex work of extracting and parsing TypeScript APIs. We're grateful to the Rush Stack team for these foundational tools.
