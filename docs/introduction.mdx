## Quick Start

```bash
npx mint-tsdocs
```

`mint-tsdocs` will automatically detect your TypeScript project, ask a few configuration questions,
and set everything up.

If you haven't configured your Mintlify docs yet, we'll do that for you too!

## Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify-Native Components" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Generates MDX files with Mintlify frontmatter (title, description, icon) and uses native Mintlify components like `<ParamField>`, `<ResponseField>`, and `<Expandable>` for rich, interactive documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automatic Navigation" icon="map">
    Automatically updates your `docs.json` file with proper navigation structure, organizing your API documentation into tabs and groups.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complex Type Support" icon="brackets-curly">
    Full support for complex TypeScript types including nested objects, unions, intersections, and generics. Nested object properties are automatically expanded with their own `<ParamField>` components.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="README Integration" icon="file-lines">
    Convert your package `README.md` to a Mintlify-compatible `index.mdx` for seamless package overview pages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize">
    Run `npx mint-tsdocs` - it auto-detects your TypeScript setup and creates configuration files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Run `npx mint-tsdocs generate` - everything happens automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Your documentation is ready to deploy with Mintlify
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize configuration (auto-detects your TypeScript setup)
npx mint-tsdocs

# Generate documentation
npx mint-tsdocs generate
```

That's it! Your API documentation is ready in the `docs/reference` folder (or wherever you configured it).

<Note>
  This documentation site itself is generated using `mint-tsdocs` - it's the ultimate example of what the tool can do!
</Note>

## What Gets Generated

When you run `mint-tsdocs`, you get:

- **MDX Files** - One file per API item (class, interface, function, etc.)
- **Rich Components** - Interactive `<ParamField>` and `<ResponseField>` components
- **Nested Documentation** - Expandable sections for complex types
- **Cross-References** - Automatic linking between related API items
- **Navigation** - Auto-updated `docs.json` with your API structure

## Built on Solid Foundations

mint-tsdocs is powered by Microsoft's excellent [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) and [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) projects, which handle the complex work of extracting and parsing TypeScript APIs. We're grateful to the Rush Stack team for these foundational tools.
