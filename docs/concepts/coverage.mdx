title: Coverage Calculation
description: Understanding how mint-tsdocs calculates documentation coverage
---

The `coverage` command helps you track the completeness of your API documentation. This guide explains how coverage is calculated and how to interpret the results.

## How Coverage Works

mint-tsdocs uses [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to analyze your project's exported API surface. This ensures that we only count items that are actually part of your public API, ignoring internal implementation details.

### What is Counted?

The coverage calculation includes the following API items if they are exported from your entry point:

- Classes
- Interfaces
- Functions
- Enums
- Type Aliases
- Variables (const/let)
- Namespaces

For container items like Classes and Interfaces, their members (methods, properties) are also counted recursively.

### What is Considered "Documented"?

An API item is considered documented if it has a TSDoc comment block associated with it.

```typescript
/**
 * This function is counted as documented.
 */
export function documentedFunction() {}

// This function is counted as undocumented.
export function undocumentedFunction() {}
```

### Internal Items

By default, items marked with the `@internal` release tag are **excluded** from coverage calculations. This allows you to have public-facing types that are not meant for consumers without negatively impacting your coverage score.

```typescript
/**
 * This item is excluded from coverage by default.
 * @internal
 */
export class InternalHelper {}
```

You can include internal items in the calculation by setting `includeInternal: true` in your configuration or using the `--include-internal` flag (if supported).

## Configuration

You can configure coverage settings in `mint-tsdocs.config.json`:

```json
{
  "coverage": {
    "threshold": 80,
    "includeInternal": false,
    "include": ["src/core/**/*.ts"],
    "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts"],
    "groupBy": "file"
  }
}
```

## Filtering

You can filter which files are included in the coverage calculation using glob patterns.

- **Include**: Only items defined in files matching these patterns are counted.
- **Exclude**: Items defined in files matching these patterns are ignored.

This is useful for excluding generated code, test utilities, or legacy parts of the codebase.

## Grouping

The coverage report can be grouped to help you identify areas that need attention.

- **None**: Shows a single total percentage.
- **File**: Breaks down coverage by source file.
- **Folder**: Breaks down coverage by source folder.

## CI/CD Integration

The `coverage` command exits with code `1` if the coverage percentage is below the configured threshold (default 80%). This makes it easy to integrate into your CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions in documentation quality.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Check Documentation Coverage
  run: npx mint-tsdocs coverage --threshold 90
```
