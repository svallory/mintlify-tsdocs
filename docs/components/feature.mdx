import { Feature } from "/snippets/tsdocs/Feature.jsx"
import { Preview } from "/snippets/tsdocs/Preview.jsx"

The `Feature` component provides a simple, flexible way to showcase features with a consistent header design. It renders a header with an icon, title, and subtitle, then displays whatever children you provide.

## Basic Usage

The component accepts a header configuration and renders any children below it.

```jsx
import { Feature } from "/snippets/tsdocs/Feature.jsx"

<Feature
  icon="pocket-knife"
  title="My Tool"
  subtitle="A brief description of this amazing tool."
>
  <p>Any content you want goes here.</p>
  <p>You have complete control over the layout.</p>
</Feature>
```
<Icon icon="flag" />

<Preview title="Basic Feature Example">
  <Feature
    icon="pocket-knife"
    title="My Tool"
    subtitle="A brief description of this amazing tool."
  >
    <p>This feature provides a flexible container for showcasing your product capabilities.</p>
    <p>You can include any content: text, lists, cards, or custom components.</p>
  </Feature>
</Preview>

## Properties

<ResponseField name="icon" type="string">
  Icon name for the feature header (e.g., "pocket-knife", "rocket"). Uses Mintlify's Icon component. Optional.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
  The title of the feature. It will be rendered inside a `<code>` tag.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="subtitle" type="string" required>
  A short description that appears below the main title.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="children" type="ReactNode">
  Any React content to display below the header. This gives you complete flexibility in how you structure your feature content.
</ResponseField>

## Using with Cards

The Feature component works great with Mintlify's Card components for creating highlight grids.

```jsx
<Feature
  icon="pocket-knife"
  title="hyper gen"
  subtitle="Code generation engine for the age of AI."
>
  <p>
    Beyond anything you can do with Yeoman and similar tools, hyper templates
    support <strong>prompt placeholders</strong> that integrate rule-based
    generation with AI-driven generation.
  </p>

    <Card title="Starter Kits" icon="box">

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Consistent Icons" icon="image">
    Use icons from a single library and style to maintain visual consistency across your features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Titles Concise" icon="heading">
    Feature titles should be short and memorable - ideally 1-3 words that quickly communicate the value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compose with Cards" icon="layout-grid">
    Leverage Mintlify's Card and CardGroup components within Feature children for professional layouts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Structure Your Content" icon="sitemap">
    Start with a brief introduction paragraph, then present details using cards, lists, or other structured content.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Styling

The Feature component uses minimal, semantic CSS classes:

- `.feature-article` - Main container with dark background
- `.feature-header` - Header section wrapper
- `.feature-title` - Title with icon
- `.feature-subtitle` - Subtitle text
- `.feature-content` - Content wrapper for children

The component automatically adapts to light and dark modes. You can override styles in your `docs/style.css`.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Component not found" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Ensure the Feature.jsx file exists in `docs/snippets/tsdocs/` and your import path is correct: `/snippets/tsdocs/Feature.jsx`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Styling looks wrong" icon="paintbrush">
    The Feature component relies on `tsdocs-styles.css`. Verify:
    1. The CSS file is properly imported in your Mintlify configuration
    2. Custom styles in `docs/style.css` aren't overriding defaults unintentionally
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cards not displaying in grid" icon="layout-grid">
    Make sure you're using Mintlify's CardGroup component to wrap your Card components, and set the `cols` prop to control the grid layout.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
