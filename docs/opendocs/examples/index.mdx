# Implementation Examples

<Warning>
  **RFC Status**: This section contains proposed examples for the OpenDocs Specification RFC.

  These examples are provided to illustrate how the specification could be implemented.
  [Provide feedback](https://github.com/svallory/mintlify-tsdocs/issues) to help refine these examples.
</Warning>

## Overview

This page provides concrete examples of implementing OpenDocs in various scenarios, from simple single-language projects to complex multi-language monorepos.
