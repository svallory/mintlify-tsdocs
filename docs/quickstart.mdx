## Your First Documentation

You're starting fresh. Run this in your TypeScript project:

```bash
npx mint-tsdocs
```

The tool auto-detects your TypeScript entry point and asks a few configuration questions. If you don't have a Mintlify project yet, it'll create one for you using the Mintlify CLI.

<Tip>
  In a hurry? Use `--yes` to accept all defaults: `npx mint-tsdocs --yes`
</Tip>

Then generate your docs:

```bash
npx mint-tsdocs generate
```

Preview them:

```bash
cd docs && mintlify dev
```

Your docs are live at `http://localhost:3000`. You've got MDX files for every exported API item, automatic navigation in `docs.json`, and interactive components for complex types.

## Keeping Docs Fresh

You've shipped v1.2.0 with new features. Your types changed. Your docs need updating.

Just run the generate command again:

```bash
npx mint-tsdocs generate
```

That's it. The tool regenerates everything from your source code. New classes appear in the docs, removed ones disappear, changed signatures update automatically. Your `docs.json` navigation stays in sync.

<Tip>
  Add `"docs": "mint-tsdocs generate"` to your `package.json` scripts. Now you can run `npm run docs` or `bun docs`.
</Tip>

## Customizing Output

The default templates look great, but you need your own branding or structure.

Initialize your template directory:

```bash
npx mint-tsdocs customize -t ./templates
```

This copies all default templates to `./templates`. Now edit them:

- Change `class.liquid` to add custom sections
- Modify `function.liquid` to highlight examples differently
- Update `layout.liquid` to match your brand

Next time you run `generate`, your customizations apply automatically. You still get updates to templates you didn't modify.

<Note>
  Templates use [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/). Check the [Template Reference](/reference/templates) for available variables and examples.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"No API items found"**

Your `entryPoint` in `mint-tsdocs.config.json` probably points to the wrong file. It needs your compiled `.d.ts` file (usually in `lib/` or `dist/`), not your source `.ts` files. Run `bun build` first.

**"Navigation not updating"**

Check your `docsJson` path in config. The tool needs write access to update `docs.json`. Make sure the path is correct and the file exists.

**"Types not rendering correctly"**

Complex generic types sometimes need manual documentation. Add JSDoc comments with `@remarks` or `@example` tags to provide context that can't be inferred from type signatures alone.

**"Build fails with TypeScript errors"**

API Extractor is strict about type safety. If your project builds but API Extractor fails, check for:
- Missing type annotations on exported functions
- `any` types in public API
- Circular dependencies
