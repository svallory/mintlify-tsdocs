# IndentedWriter











## Summary

A utility for writing indented text.





## Signature

```typescript
export declare class IndentedWriter 
```








## Constructors



### (constructor)




Constructs a new instance of the  class





## Properties



### defaultIndentPrefix




**Type**: defaultIndentPrefix: string;







**Default**: ``



The text characters used to create one level of indentation. Two spaces by default.





## Methods



### decreaseIndent






Decreases the indentation, reverting the effect of the corresponding call to IndentedWriter.increaseIndent().



### ensureNewLine






Adds a newline if the file pointer is not already at the start of the line (or start of the stream).



### ensureSkippedLine






Adds up to two newlines to ensure that there is a blank line above the current line.



### getText






Retrieves the output that was built so far.



### increaseIndent






Increases the indentation. Normally the indentation is two spaces, however an arbitrary prefix can optional be specified. (For example, the prefix could be &quot;// &quot; to indent and comment simultaneously.) Each call to IndentedWriter.increaseIndent() must be followed by a corresponding call to IndentedWriter.decreaseIndent().



### indentScope






A shorthand for ensuring that increaseIndent()/decreaseIndent() occur in pairs.



### peekLastCharacter






Returns the last character that was written, or an empty string if no characters have been written yet.



### peekSecondLastCharacter






Returns the second to last character that was written, or an empty string if less than one characters have been written yet.



### toString










### write






Writes some text to the internal string buffer, applying indentation according to the current indentation level. If the string contains multiple newlines, each line will be indented separately.



### writeLine






A shorthand for writing an optional message, followed by a newline. Indentation is applied following the semantics of IndentedWriter.write().



### writeTentative






Writes  and  messages if and only if  writes anything.If  writes &quot;CONTENT&quot;, this method will write &quot;CONTENT&quot;. If  writes nothing, this method will write nothing.





## Events


*No events defined.*





## Remarks

Note that the indentation is inserted at the last possible opportunity. For example, this code......would produce this output:
