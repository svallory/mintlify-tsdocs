# CustomMarkdownEmitter

## Summary

Custom markdown emitter that extends the base MarkdownEmitter to provide Mintlify-specific formatting and cross-reference resolution.  This emitter converts TSDoc tables into Mintlify components (ParamField, ResponseField, TypeTree) for better documentation UX. It also handles API reference resolution with caching for performance.  ## Architecture  The emission process follows this flow: 1. TSDoc nodes are traversed recursively via `writeNode()` 2. Tables are detected and classified by their header content 3. Property tables → TypeTree components with nested object support 4. Method/Constructor tables → ResponseField components 5. Other tables → HTML table fallback  ## Security Considerations  All user content is sanitized through SecurityUtils before being embedded in JSX/MDX: - `sanitizeJsxAttribute()` - For JSX attribute values (prevents quote escape attacks) - `sanitizeJsonForJsx()` - For JSON data embedded in JSX props - `getEscapedText()` - For markdown content (prevents markdown injection)  Note: Content injection (XSS, template injection) is NOT a threat because users generate documentation from their own code for their own sites. Security focus is on command injection and path traversal (see CLAUDE.md).  ## Caching Strategy  API reference resolution is cached via ApiResolutionCache (LRU cache) to avoid repeated expensive lookups during documentation generation. Cache is ephemeral (per-run) and does not persist across builds.  
## Signature

```typescript
export declare class CustomMarkdownEmitter extends MarkdownEmitter 
```

## Constructors

### constructor

Constructs a new instance of the class

## Properties

*No properties defined.*

## Methods

### emit

Emits markdown content from a DocNode tree.Entry point for the emission process. Delegates to parent class implementation which handles the recursive node traversal via .

### writeLinkTagWithCodeDestination
**Modifiers**: protected

Writes a link tag that references code entities (API items).Overrides parent implementation to: 1. Resolve API references via ApiModel with caching 2. Generate markdown links to resolved items' documentation pages 3. Use scoped names as link text when not explicitly provided

### writeNode
**Modifiers**: protected

Writes a single DocNode to the output.Overrides parent implementation to add custom handling for: - DocHeading - Markdown headings with configurable levels - DocNoteBox - Block quotes for note/warning boxes - DocTable - Mintlify components (TypeTree, ResponseField) or HTML fallback - DocEmphasisSpan - Bold/italic text spans - DocExpandable - Collapsible sectionsAll other node types delegate to parent class.
