# IndentedWriter

## Summary

A utility for writing indented text.  
## Signature

```typescript
export declare class IndentedWriter 
```

## Constructors

### constructor

Constructs a new instance of the class

## Properties

### defaultIndentPrefix
**Type**:`defaultIndentPrefix: string;`
**Default**: ``

The text characters used to create one level of indentation. Two spaces by default.

## Methods

### decreaseIndent

Decreases the indentation, reverting the effect of the corresponding call to IndentedWriter.increaseIndent().

### ensureNewLine

Adds a newline if the file pointer is not already at the start of the line (or start of the stream).

### ensureSkippedLine

Adds up to two newlines to ensure that there is a blank line above the current line.

### getText

Retrieves the output that was built so far.

### increaseIndent

Increases the indentation. Normally the indentation is two spaces, however an arbitrary prefix can optional be specified. (For example, the prefix could be "// " to indent and comment simultaneously.) Each call to IndentedWriter.increaseIndent() must be followed by a corresponding call to IndentedWriter.decreaseIndent().

### indentScope

A shorthand for ensuring that increaseIndent()/decreaseIndent() occur in pairs.

### peekLastCharacter

Returns the last character that was written, or an empty string if no characters have been written yet.

### peekSecondLastCharacter

Returns the second to last character that was written, or an empty string if less than one characters have been written yet.

### toString



### write

Writes some text to the internal string buffer, applying indentation according to the current indentation level. If the string contains multiple newlines, each line will be indented separately.

### writeLine

A shorthand for writing an optional message, followed by a newline. Indentation is applied following the semantics of IndentedWriter.write().

### writeTentative

Writes and messages if and only if writes anything.If writes "CONTENT", this method will write "CONTENT". If writes nothing, this method will write nothing.

## Events

*No events defined.*

## Remarks

  Note that the indentation is inserted at the last possible opportunity. For example, this code...  ...would produce this output:
