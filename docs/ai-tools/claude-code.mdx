Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool. This guide shows how to set up Claude Code to help you adopt mint-tsdocs and maintain your TypeScript API documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)
- Your documentation site deployed (for MCP integration)

## Why use Claude Code with mint-tsdocs?

Connecting Claude Code to your documentation helps you:
- **Learn faster**: Query your generated API reference without reading hundreds of pages
- **Maintain consistency**: Get help writing docs that match your existing patterns
- **Fix issues quickly**: Ask Claude to search your docs and fix broken links or outdated examples
- **Customize templates**: Get context-aware help when modifying Liquid templates

## Setup

1. Install Claude Code globally:

  ```bash
  bun install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```

2. Navigate to your docs directory
3. (Optional) Add the `CLAUDE.md` file below to your project
4. (Recommended) Connect to your documentation's MCP server
5. Run `claude` to start

## Connect to your documentation (MCP)

<Note>
Mintlify automatically generates an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for your documentation at `https://your-docs-url/mcp`. This lets Claude Code search and reference your docs in real-time.
</Note>

Once your documentation is deployed, connect Claude Code to your MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http mint-tsdocs https://your-docs-url/mcp
```

Replace `your-docs-url` with your actual documentation URL. For example:
- `https://docs.yourcompany.com/mcp`
- `https://yourproject.mintlify.app/mcp`

<Tip>
Name the MCP connection something descriptive like `my-project-docs` instead of `mint-tsdocs` if you're working on multiple projects.
</Tip>

### Verify the connection

After connecting, ask Claude Code to search your documentation:

```
You: Search my docs for how to customize templates
Claude: [Searches your MCP server and returns relevant results from your API reference]
```

## Create `CLAUDE.md`

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your documentation repository to train Claude Code on your specific documentation standards:

````markdown
# Mintlify documentation

## Working relationship
- You can push back on ideas-this can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information

## Project context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
- Components: Mintlify components

## Content strategy
- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability of information
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing information before adding new content. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes

## Frontmatter requirements for pages
- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedural content
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Include both basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links

## Git workflow
- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask how to handle uncommitted changes before starting
- Create a new branch when no clear branch exists for changes
- Commit frequently throughout development
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks

## Do not
- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification

## Using your generated API reference

Once you've generated your API documentation with `mint-tsdocs generate`, you have hundreds of reference pages that Claude Code can help you leverage:

### Ask about your API

With MCP connected, Claude can search your generated API reference:

```
You: What parameters does the CacheManager constructor accept?
Claude: [Searches your API reference and explains CacheManagerOptions]

You: Show me all the template-related interfaces in my API
Claude: [Finds ITemplateData, ITemplateEngineOptions, etc. from your reference]
```

### Get help linking between pages

```
You: I need to link from my quickstart to the MarkdownDocumenter class reference
Claude: Use the relative path `/reference/mint-tsdocs.markdowndocumenter`
```

### Maintain consistency

```
You: I'm adding a new guide. Can you check what frontmatter structure my existing guides use?
Claude: [Scans your docs and shows the pattern]
```

### Update examples across pages

```
You: Find all code examples that import from 'mint-tsdocs' and update them to use the new import path
Claude: [Searches and helps update multiple pages]
```

<Tip>
The more you interact with your docs through Claude Code, the better it understands your project's patterns and can help maintain consistency.
</Tip>

## Common workflows

### Learning mint-tsdocs

When getting started:

```
You: What's the difference between ITemplateData and ITemplateEngineOptions?
You: Show me an example of customizing a template
You: How do I configure the navigation for generated API pages?
```

### Troubleshooting

```
You: I'm getting a template error. Search my docs for template debugging
You: The API reference isn't generating. Check the config reference for common issues
```

### Writing guides

```
You: I'm writing a guide about template customization. What should I link to in the API reference?
You: Check if there's already a guide about TypeInfo generation
```
