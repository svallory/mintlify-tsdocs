<Note>
The contextual menu adds AI tool options directly to your documentation pages. This guide focuses on recommended configurations for mint-tsdocs projects with large API references.

For full contextual menu features and options, see [Mintlify's contextual menu documentation](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/ai/contextual-menu).
</Note>

## Why add a contextual menu?

When you generate 400+ API reference pages with mint-tsdocs, the contextual menu helps users:

- **Quick questions**: Copy a class definition to ask their AI tool about usage
- **Deep exploration**: Open ChatGPT/Claude with an entire API page as context
- **Editor setup**: Install your MCP server in Cursor/VS Code with one click
- **Share context**: Export pages as markdown for team discussions

Think of it as a "Share to AI" button on every page of your API reference.

## Recommended configuration

Add to your `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "contextual": {
    "options": ["copy", "claude", "mcp", "cursor"]
  }
}
```

This gives users:
- `copy` - Copy page as markdown (works with any AI tool)
- `claude` - Open in Claude.ai with page context
- `mcp` - Copy your MCP server URL for manual setup
- `cursor` - One-click MCP installation in Cursor

### Why these options for mint-tsdocs?

| Option | Benefit for API Reference |
|--------|---------------------------|
| `copy` | Universal - works with any AI tool, perfect for "explain this interface" questions |
| `claude`/`chatgpt` | Pre-loads entire page context for deep exploration of complex types |
| `mcp` | Quick copy for manual MCP setup across different tools |
| `cursor`/`vscode` | One-click installation removes friction for editor-based workflows |

<Tip>
Start with 3-4 options. Too many choices can overwhelm users. You can always add more based on usage.
</Tip>

## Configuration examples

### Minimal (open source projects)

```json
{
  "contextual": {
    "options": ["copy", "mcp"]
  }
}
```

Good for: Projects where users may have various AI tool preferences.

### Developer-focused

```json
{
  "contextual": {
    "options": ["copy", "claude", "cursor", "vscode"]
  }
}
```

Good for: Projects targeting developers who use AI-enhanced editors.

### Comprehensive

```json
{
  "contextual": {
    "options": ["copy", "chatgpt", "claude", "perplexity", "mcp", "cursor", "vscode"]
  }
}
```

Good for: Maximizing discoverability, especially for complex APIs.

## Use cases with generated API reference

### Exploring complex interfaces

User visits `ITemplateData` reference page:
1. Clicks contextual menu → "Open in Claude"
2. Claude opens with full interface definition
3. Asks: "Explain each property and when I'd use it"

### Debugging type errors

User encounters error with `MarkdownDocumenter`:
1. Opens the class reference page
2. Clicks "Copy" from contextual menu
3. Pastes into their AI tool with error message
4. Gets context-aware troubleshooting

### Template customization

User customizing Liquid templates:
1. Opens `ITemplateData` reference
2. Clicks "Install MCP in Cursor"
3. Works in Cursor with AI that knows available template variables

### Team knowledge sharing

Developer discussing implementation:
1. Opens `NavigationManager` reference
2. Clicks "Copy"
3. Pastes in Slack/Discord: "Should we use this for our custom navigation?"

## Verifying the menu

After adding to `docs.json` and deploying:

1. Visit any API reference page (e.g., `/reference/mint-tsdocs.cachemanager`)
2. Look for the AI menu icon (usually top-right)
3. Click to see your configured options
4. Test the "Copy" option - should copy page content as markdown

<Check>
The menu appears on all pages, including your entire generated API reference.
</Check>

## Promoting the feature

Help users discover the contextual menu in your documentation:

### In your README

```markdown
## AI-Assisted Documentation

Each API reference page has an AI menu (⋮) with options to:
- Copy as markdown for your AI tool
- Open in Claude/ChatGPT with full context
- Install our MCP server for real-time search

Try it on any [API reference page](/reference/mint-tsdocs.cachemanager).
```

### In your quickstart guide

```markdown
<Tip>
New to our API? Click the AI menu on any reference page to ask questions
about that specific class or interface in your preferred AI tool.
</Tip>
```

## Custom options (optional)

For organization-specific integrations, you can add custom menu items. See [Mintlify's contextual menu docs](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/ai/contextual-menu#custom-options) for details.

Example for internal tools:

```json
{
  "contextual": {
    "options": [
      "copy",
      "mcp",
      {
        "title": "Search Internal Examples",
        "description": "Find usage in our codebase",
        "icon": "github",
        "href": {
          "url": "https://github.com/yourorg/search",
          "params": { "q": "$path" }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
